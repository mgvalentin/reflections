Lesson 2

git init   from a new folder will create a new repository with that folder name.

mvalent2 reflections $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/mvalent2/mgvlib.cablevision/Personal/Udacity/How to Use Git and GitHub/reflections/.git/


git status    will now show us the status of that repository

mvalent2 (master #) reflections $ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	lesson_1_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)



Note, git init   does NOT create an initial commit.  We need to do that ourselves.
Thus the git status shows us an initial commit as blank  and untracked files


What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git will create a new repository with the folder name and create a hidden  .git   folder that contains the meta data for the repository
This is needed for tracking your code changes under this new repository


to add files to the new git repository, the need to be included via   git add  command
then when we use   git commit   they'll be added from the "staging" area to the repository
