using GitHub for this lesson

pushing a local repository to the remote github repository

create an empty repository remotely on github; these are called 'remotes'


forking a respository vs. cloning it

when adding commits to the local and remote independently, you end up with repositories that are out of sync
if working alone, not an issue unless you work on multiple machines
with a team of people

git pull origin master
	is the same as
git fetch origin
git merge master origin/master


fast-forward merge
when you can get to an ancestor from a current commit branch

when updating code, pull the origin repository to your local machine to ensure that you are in sync with the local rep
then branch locally, create your code, but don't merge into the master.  Then push this new branch to the remote.
this allows you now to create a pull request for someone to review the new branch.

think of a "pull" request as a "merge" request as we are asking someone to review the changes made and pull those changes into the master branch

changes to the master or branches to the master on the remote MUST be pulled to your local
before you merge into master and push to remote
if you're not sure what the changes are on the remote, you can git fetch first to review the changes
and if satisified, merge the master with the origin/master
